# ml_steam_player_trends
## CSE 163 Final Project on the trends of the number of players playing a game on Steam.

To run our project you need to clone it. This can be done by clicking on the "Clone or download" button (you can either do SSH or HTTPS but I would recommend using SSH). The link to our our github repository is [here](https://github.com/phoang7/ml_steam_player_trends). Go to your terminal or command prompt (you could probably use Visual Studio Code or some IDE but I would recommend using terminal or command prompt) and run `steam.py` on Python3 (command: `python steam.py`). `clean.py` does not need to be run as it is is module in `steam.py` to clean up our data.

When you run `steam.py`, you will need a few libaries installed. You will need to install the following libraries:
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `sklearn`
* `pandas`

This can be done but either installing through `pip` or an virutal environment (such as `conda`). Our data is provided in the `data` directory so you can view our data there or download it by cloning (as mentioned in the previous paragraph).

To view the graphs that are saved in `steam.py`, go to the `graphs` directory so you can the graphs there or download it by cloning (as mentioned in the 1st paragraph).

If you do not know how to use git or install libaries, some resources are provided below for help:
